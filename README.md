HazeLight
=========

HazeLight is a basic client for CloudFlareâ„¢ on iOS 7. Developed using the Cocoa Touch APIs and test driven development, it is still a work in progress.

How to Build
=========

HazeLight uses CocoaPods for its testing frameworks. If you wish to build without tests, just build the Xcode project like normal. Otherwise, install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and run `pod install` from the cloned directory.
